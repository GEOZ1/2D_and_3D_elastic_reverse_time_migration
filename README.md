# 2D_and_3D_elastic_reverse_time_migration
2D and 3D elastic reverse time migration using wavefield decomposition and vector-based excitation amplitude imaging condition.  
I utilize the GPUs to speed up all the elastic wavefield extrapolations and application of the imaging conditions in the 3D case.

Note:
     2D_elastic_RTM programa can also implement elastic and viscoelastic LSRTM
